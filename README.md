## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Font Awesome (Social Icons)

### What I learned

I used the project to refresh my knowledge of semantic HTML and CSS. The use of Media Query to make it responsive to different devices is currently essential for development.

### Continued development

For the future I want to follow a specific development process, developing a workflow to speed up and organize the code makes larger scale projects easier, making them more understandable when making them.
